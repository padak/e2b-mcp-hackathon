# Ideas & Notes

## Polymarket Focus Areas

### Federal Reserve (FED) Category
Polymarket has an entire category dedicated to Federal Reserve decisions and economic events. This could be an excellent focus area for our simulation demo because:

- **High volume markets** - FED-related markets typically have significant trading volume
- **Clear resolution criteria** - Rate decisions have definitive outcomes
- **Rich data for simulation** - Economic indicators, historical rates, inflation data
- **Timely relevance** - Regular FOMC meetings create recurring opportunities

Example markets:
- Fed rate hike in 2025?
- Fed emergency rate cut in 2025?
- US recession in 2025?

### Potential Demo Scenarios
1. Simulate Fed rate decision impact on markets
2. Model economic shock scenarios (recession probability)
3. Compare simulation results with market consensus
