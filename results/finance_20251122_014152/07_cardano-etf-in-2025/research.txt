As of late November 2025, a **Cardano (ADA) ETF has not yet launched**, but there is significant momentum and expectation that one could appear by the end of the year or early 2026, subject to regulatory approval[1][3][4][5].

**Current Status and Latest News**
- Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard confirmed active work and ongoing discussions with fund issuers for a spot ADA ETF, with a target launch as early as next year, depending on regulatory approvals[1][3].
- The **SEC has delayed its decision on the high-profile Grayscale Cardano ETF to October 2025**. Despite this postponement linked in part to regulatory slowdowns and earlier US government shutdowns, optimism persists regarding eventual approval[4][5].
- Institutional and whale investors have shown strong interest, with on-chain data noting large accumulations of ADA even amid regulatory delays—indicating sustained confidence in an eventual ETF[4].

**Key Statistics**
- In the run-up to a potential ETF, whales have accumulated *over 348 million ADA* (≈$200 million), signaling faith in a forthcoming product[4].
- ADA remains a top-5 cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is included in several institutional crypto indices, positioning it well for ETF candidacy[6].

**Expert Opinions and Institutional Context**
- Industry analysts view a Cardano ETF as a likely step in the progression following the successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs earlier in 2024[1][6].
- The Cardano Foundation is actively “bridging traditional finance with blockchain innovation,” aiming to make ADA more accessible to mainstream and institutional investors through regulated products[1][3][6].
- Regulatory experts note that broader ETF approval trends and growing institutional adoption increase the odds, but the process can be delayed by macroeconomic uncertainty and periodic regulatory hurdles, as seen with the SEC’s postponements[4][5][6].

**Factors Likely to Influence the Outcome**
- **SEC and Regulatory Decisions:** Any further US government shutdowns or changes in regulatory leadership could cause more delays[4][5].
- **Market Trends:** Outflows from existing crypto ETFs (notably Bitcoin’s in November 2025) reflect broader economic uncertainty, which could influence regulator appetite for new crypto funds[6].
- **Investor Demand:** Persistent high demand from both private and institutional players for regulated ADA exposure will pressure issuers and regulators toward approval[4][6].
- **Competitive Landscape:** The success of ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) builds the case for ADA while creating competitive urgency[1][6].

**Prediction Market Context**
- Polymarket and similar platforms show robust trading interest in the question, with market odds as high as 75% favoring a Cardano ETF arriving by the end of 2025, reflecting broad market optimism but not certainty[2].

**Summary Table:** Key Factors

| Factor                  | Current Status (Nov 2025)                                | Impact on ETF Approval    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| SEC Decision            | Delayed (Grayscale ADA ETF decision due Oct 2025)        | Moderate to High         |
| Institutional Demand    | Very strong (whale accumulations, index inclusions)      | High                     |
| Regulatory Climate      | Improving, but periodically unstable (shutdown, delays)  | High                     |
| Precedent               | BTC and ETH ETFs successfully launched                   | Supportive               |

**Conclusion:**  
There is no approved Cardano ETF as of November 22, 2025. The Cardano Foundation is actively pursuing it, with significant institutional backing and regulatory progress. The outlook remains positive for approval by late 2025 or early 2026, but the final outcome depends on regulatory timeline and broader market dynamics[1][3][4][5][6].
