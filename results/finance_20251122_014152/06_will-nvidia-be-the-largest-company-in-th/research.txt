**NVIDIA is currently the largest company in the world by market capitalization, and as of late November 2025, holds a significant lead over rivals, making it highly plausible (though not certain) that it will remain the largest by December 31.**

### Key Statistics

- **NVIDIA's market cap:** $4.39 trillion as of November 21, 2025[5].
- **Microsoft:** ~$3.5–$3.9 trillion in recent months[1][7].
- **Apple:** ~$3–$3.9 trillion in recent months[1][7].
- In October and November 2025, **NVIDIA’s valuation surpassed Microsoft and Apple**, with Microsoft briefly joining the “$4 trillion club,” but then trailing again[3][7].

#### Recent Growth and Position

- NVIDIA became the world’s largest company in early July 2025, driven by massive growth in demand for AI chips and data center infrastructure[3].
- Its market cap increased by over 31% in the past year, outpacing every other mega-cap technology stock[5], and it is alone among the “Magnificent 7” in reaching new all-time highs in late 2025[6].
- NVIDIA reported trailing twelve-month revenue of $148.5 billion and gross profit of $104.1 billion[1].
- Product pipeline includes leading-edge AI hardware (Hopper, Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra chips), and strong demand is expected into FY2026[4].

### Expert & Market Sentiment

- **Market analysts and prediction markets** generally expect NVIDIA to remain a leader at least through the end of 2025. For example, Manifold Markets participants strongly believe NVIDIA will maintain its top spot over competitors in the short term (Google’s chance to surpass NVIDIA by EOY 2025 is estimated at only 6%)[2].
- Some experts project NVIDIA to reach even higher milestones, such as a $10 trillion market cap before 2030, supported by continued AI sector growth and the company's wide technological moat[6].

### Influencing Factors

Several critical factors may affect whether NVIDIA stays ahead through December 31:

- **AI Demand:** NVIDIA’s leadership in AI semiconductor technology and systems, combined with a product roadmap stretching into 2026, support robust long-term growth[4].
- **Competition:** Microsoft and Apple remain close rivals and have the ability to reclaim the #1 spot if market sentiment shifts, as seen from repeated historical swaps in leadership among mega-cap technology stocks[3][7].
- **Stock Market Volatility:** Large-cap tech stocks can fluctuate rapidly, especially amid economic surprises, policy changes, or shifts in investor sentiment[3].
- **Geopolitics & Regulation:** Any major regulatory or geopolitical actions directed toward AI, chips, or U.S. tech companies could affect market caps suddenly.
- **Broader Market Conditions:** The performance of the overall stock market and tech sector will profoundly influence rankings; a market correction or rotation out of tech would threaten NVIDIA’s position.

### Recent News Drivers

- NVIDIA’s AI chip dominance has accelerated due to explosive enterprise and cloud demand.
- Microsoft, Apple, and other contenders (Alphabet, Amazon) have seen more muted growth compared to NVIDIA in the “AI bull run,” with some even declining from previous peaks[6].
- As of the latest available data, **NVIDIA is the only mega-cap stock consistently making new highs**[6][7].

### Summary Table: Market Cap Leaders (Q4 2025)

| Company    | Market Cap (USD Trillion) | Current Rank          |
|------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **NVIDIA**      | 4.39–4.53                | 1 (as of Nov 2025)    |
| Microsoft  | 3.5–3.9                   | 2                     |
| Apple      | 3.0–3.9                   | 3                     |
| Alphabet   | ~2.6                      | 4                     |
| Amazon     | ~2.4                      | 5                     |

**In conclusion, barring unexpected major market events or a dramatic surge from competitors, NVIDIA is on track to remain the world’s largest company by market cap on December 31, 2025; but as historical precedent shows, tech mega-cap rankings can change rapidly[3][7][2].**
