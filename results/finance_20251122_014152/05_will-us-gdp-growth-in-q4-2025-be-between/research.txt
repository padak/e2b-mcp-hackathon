Current forecasts and expert commentary suggest that **US GDP growth in Q4 2025 is likely to fall within or very near the 1.5%–2.0% range**, though projections are subject to revision given the economic slowdown, recent policy uncertainty, and lingering effects of earlier shocks[2][3][6][7][16].

**Recent News and Key Statistics**
- Q2 2025 GDP growth was strong at **3.8% annualized**, but expectations for Q4 show a **notable slowdown**[1][13][15].
- The median projection from major sources for **Q4 2025 GDP growth is around 2.1%**[2], with some forecasters placing it slightly lower. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Q4 2025 survey shows consensus on **annual GDP growth of 1.9% for 2025**[3].
- EY forecasts **Q4 2025 growth at 1.2% year-over-year (y/y)**, but 1.7% for the full year[16].
- The Conference Board revised its Q4 2025 growth expectations **down to 1.5%** on a Q4-over-Q4 basis, due to cooling momentum and the impact of a government shutdown that is estimated to shave **~0.5 percentage points off quarterly growth**[6][7].

**Expert Opinions**
- Most forecasting institutions and professional forecasters now see real growth slowing as consumer spending cools, following a strong post-pandemic surge[1][2][3][4][6].
- The probability of recession has risen, with downside risks highlighted by several outlooks[4][6].
- Economists attribute the slowdown to a mix of factors: higher interest rates, cooling labor market, persistent inflation pressures, and policy uncertainty (including the recent federal shutdown’s estimated effect on Q4 activity)[2][6][7][16].

**Factors Influencing Q4 2025 GDP Outcome**
- **Monetary Policy:** Tighter interest rates have moderated borrowing and investment, weighing on demand[2][4][10].
- **Government Shutdown:** Ripple effects from suspended contracts and spending are expected to dampen Q4 GDP, but some losses may be recouped early in 2026[7].
- **Consumer Spending:** Growth is moderating due to higher borrowing costs and cautious household sentiment[2][5].
- **Business Investment:** Nonresidential investment faces headwinds from increased financing costs and policy uncertainty[2].
- **Global Factors:** Weakness in global demand and trade disruptions could further restrain growth, although some sectors (such as AI related investment) offset declines[4].
- **Risk of Further Slowdown:** If consumer confidence or the global outlook deteriorate, growth may underperform even these muted forecasts[2][4][5].

**Summary**
- The most authoritative estimates cluster around **1.5%–2.1%** for Q4 2025, with several experts assigning greater weight to risks on the downside, especially in light of recent federal disruptions and the softer trajectory for household spending and investment[2][3][6][7][16].
- While the midpoint of forecasts is close to the prediction market range, there remains considerable uncertainty pending official BEA release (January 30, 2026) and evolving macro conditions.
