The most recent market data show a **60–70% probability of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut at the December 2025 meeting, with the remainder betting on no change**[1][2][4][5]. While futures and most analysts expect a cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent remarks signaled greater uncertainty, pushing back against expectations for an automatic reduction[1][6].

**Recent News and Market Context**
- The Fed executed a 25-basis-point cut in October 2025, setting the current federal funds target range at **3.75%–4.00%**[2][5].
- Leading into December, market odds for another cut dropped from above 80% to 60–70% after Powell stated the decision was "not a foregone conclusion," emphasizing a need for clearer disinflation and weaker labor data before additional easing[1][6].
- **Fed futures and swaps** indicate investors remain split, with hedging evident in positioning, reflecting heightened uncertainty and volatility reminiscent of mid-2023[1].

**Key Statistics and Expert Opinions**
- **Core PCE inflation** is around **2.6%**, just above the Fed’s 2% target[1].
- **Wage growth** has been firm, though job creation is slowing modestly[1].
- Consensus economist forecasts (e.g., from J.P. Morgan and market surveys) generally expect the federal funds rate to decline to **3.5% by year-end**, but with increased caution about the number and timing of further cuts[2][3][4].
- The Fed’s own September 2025 dot plot shows a median rate of **3.6% by end-2025**, implying one to two additional 25-basis-point cuts, but market participants sometimes price in a slightly more aggressive path[4].

**Factors That Could Influence the Outcome**
- **Employment:** A sharp uptick in unemployment claims or a weak payroll report could tip the Fed toward another cut[1].
- **Inflation:** Sudden drops in CPI/PCE readings would bolster the case for cutting; stubborn or resurgent inflation could prompt a pause[1][2].
- **Economic Growth:** Upgrades to U.S. GDP forecasts (e.g., to 1.5% for 2025) and strong business investment add to arguments for holding rates steady[6].
- **Market Volatility and Financial Stability:** Surges in volatility or financial stress could change the Fed’s stance abruptly.

**Summary Table – December 2025 FOMC Scenarios**

| Outcome               | Probability   | Key Triggers                                  | Recent Commentary    |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 25 bps rate cut       | 60–70%       | Weak labor/inflation data                     | Market base case[1][2][4] |
| No change             | 30–40%       | Resilient jobs, steady inflation, solid growth| Fed guidance, hawkish shift[1][5][6] |
| 50 bps+ cut           | <10%         | Major downturn or severe economic shock       | Considered unlikely[1][2] |

**Current Expert Consensus:**  
Traders anticipate a modest cut, citing cooling inflation and softer labor, but volatility in positioning and Powell’s admonition that decisions will be data-dependent have left the race wide open[1][2][4][6]. A “no change” outcome, while a minority view, is plausible if inflation remains sticky or growth data surpass expectations[1][5][6].

**Conclusion:**  
While the market currently expects a cut, the possibility of no change after the December 2025 meeting remains credible and is gaining attention as economic data evolves and Fed communication becomes more cautious[1][2][5][6].
